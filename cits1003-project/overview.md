# Overview

### Availability

The project questions/challenges will become available on the CTF flag submission site: [https://labs.cits1003.jinhong.org/](https://labs.cits1003.jinhong.org) around week 6 (tentative). Please stay tuned.

### Questions

The project consists of four topics: (1) Computer Architecture and Networking, (2) Cryptography (3) Forensics, and (4) Vulnerabilities. Each topic consists of four questions (total 16 questions) with varying difficulties (easy, medium and hard). Easy questions are 10 points, Medium questions are 20 points and Hard questions are 25 points. The points will add up to 250 points for 25% of your unit grade.



### Your tasks and how the project is graded

Your task is to find flags for the provided 16 questions to obtain as many points as possible (the format for the flags is: UWA{xxx} where xxx is the flag you have found). Please note that, questions in the projects normally extend the questions you have seen in the labs, which means you are expected to carry out your own research on top of the knowledge you have gained from lectures and labs to find the flags.

In addition, you will submit a write-up report summarising how you found the flag for each attempted question. Based on the level of understanding and correctness of your report, you may retain or lose marks you have achieved on the CTF flag submission site (i.e., you can lose marks if your write-up report is deemed insufficient to demonstrate the skills and knowledge).

You may also be requested for an interview for us to clarify any misunderstandings found in your report. If you fail to organise a time to have an interview, you may lose marks for the questions we need clarifications. We will make a reasonable attempt to organise an interview session.

Your write-up report is submitted on LMS (a single PDF file, others are ignored/unmarked), you will find a report submission page.

### Duration

The project starts from (week 7) 17 April 2023 and will close on (week 12) Friday 26 May 2023 5pm (6 weeks). There should be plenty of time to complete the project.

### Getting help

Yes, you can ask for help during the labs but the lab facilitators won't be giving you the answers directly but give you a general direction to explore from. You can also discuss on Teams, but make sure you are not giving away answers or workflow that leads to answers directly. You are also welcome to discuss the general approach to solving the challenges, but you should not share flags or provide walkthroughs. Penalties are severe as this falls into academic misconduct.

### Academic misconduct

If you are unsure whether what you planning to do would be academic misconduct or not, please check with the lab facilitators or the unit coordinator.&#x20;

### Final reminder

Please do not seek to get flags from your friends/classmates/others, as it compromises your learning which will affect your future studies significantly (i.e., things only get harder so you need to know how to do things on your own).

Please do not share the flags you found, it jeopardizes their learning which also significantly affects their future studies.
